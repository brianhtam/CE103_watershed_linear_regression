# Hello, welcome to the blog for Brian and Anindia!

For our mission one we decided to analyze the water balance of the Fernow Experimental Forest.

Does logging vegetation change streamflow? We found this location especially interesting since the Forest consists of 7 different watersheds, with each of these sections consisting of different properties. Some sheds gone through more logging than others. How does different levels of logging and terrain affect the the overall flux of water in and out of these areas? Join us as we explore!

## This blog is broken up into four parts:

The first part explains the history and significance of the Fernow Experimental Forest.

The second part we analyzed the the 7 distinct watersheds and compared their water levels.

The third part looks into a study by Alice Brown on the changes in water yield resulting from alteration in vegetation, comparing this study with the results we acquired from the Fernow Experimental Forest.

Please tell us where we can improve!

Fernow Experimental Forest is a research forest located in West Virginia and was established in 1934. Extensive clear cutting on the land occurred between 1905 and 1910 and subsequently in the early 1950&#39;s, leaving most trees with less than 5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH). The laboratory research projects conducted mainly focus on forest hydrology and how forest management practices such as clear cutting affect water quality, water yield, and erosion. But within its 80 years of existence, the Forest has also been contributing to research on biodiversity, endangered species management, carbon sequestration, atmospheric deposition, and climate change.
